<h1>Level 4</h1>
<p>Insecure Inc. has organized a poll for Employee of the Month in which each nominee is rated on a scale of 5 and 
the final rating is calculated using the average of all the votes given.</p>
<p>It seems that one candidate has unscrupulously increased his rating to an impossible value. Your friend Harry, who is one of the nominees, 
has requested you to increase his rating to a value greater than that of John. Can you pull it off?</p>
